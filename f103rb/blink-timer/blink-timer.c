/*
 * Timer based Blink
 *
 * This is another way to get a more precise time delay, using a
 * timer. 
 *
 * The STM32 chips have a number of timers associated with them from
 * simple to quite complex. ST tries to keep timers with the same name
 * on every chip to have the same characteristics. As a result you
 * can have a timer called "TIM6" (logically timer 6) which is on a
 * part with only 4 timers. 
 *
 * In this case TIM6, aka Timer 6, is a really simple implementation of
 * the timer and doesn't have the fancy capture and PWM features that
 * the more sophisticated timers have. That makes it idea for using as
 * a simple delay timer.

	 * The timer clocks are generated by the peripheral bus they are attached
	 * to by default. If the prescaler is set to anything other than 1,
	 * the timer clock is 2x the APB clock.
	 * Timer 6 is attached to APB1 so its clocked internally at 2 * 36 MHz or
	 * 72 MHz. 
	 *
	 * The timer clock goes into a prescaler (TIM6_PSC) which is a 'divide
	 * by n' where n is (PSC value + 1) (so if the PSC has 0 in it, which
	 * is the default, it divides by (0 + 1) or 1. Using the prescaler,
	 * we can set the interval between counts. The PSC is a 16 bit unsigned
	 * value so the maximum prescale value is 65,536 (65,535 + 1).
	 *
	 * For example, setting PSC to 71, equivalent to divide by 72, the
	 * timer will divide the 72 MHz clock to a 1 MHz clock. Thus each count
	 * in the timer represents 1 uS in time. Alternatively, setting it to 7199
	 * means the clock is 10 kHz so each count represents 100 uS.
	 *
	 * Timer 6's count is loaded into the ARR register. For timer 6, it only
	 * counts up (other counters have more flexible counting schemes).
	 *
	 * It is important to note that the UIF flag is set on *overflow*. What
	 * that means for this code is that the counter goes up to the count loaded
	 * into ARR, and then ONE MORE COUNT before it overflows. So one way to
	 * think of that is that the ARR register is one less than the actual
	 * delay. 
	 *
	 * Timer 6's prescaler and count are both 16 bit values, the timer counts
	 * up, so setting the count (ARR) to 0xffff means it will count all the
	 * way to 65,535 and then one more count to overflow. Thus the maximum
	 * delay you could create in this situation is 65536 / 1281.7383 or 51.1
	 * seconds.
	 *
	 * Some chips have Timer 5 and Timer 2 which are 32 bit counters and
	 * can give you much longer delays.
