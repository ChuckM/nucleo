# UART Example

This code uses the UART API to initialize the UART on the Nucleo board
that is present on the USB port when you plug it into your computer.

It demonstrates some of the various APIs and it also shows that you can
use the C library `printf` function if you have included the UART code
in your executable.

The code example simply asks for you to type something and then it echos it
back to you and tells you how many characters were read.
